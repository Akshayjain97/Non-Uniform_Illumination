# Non-Uniform_Illumination
we introduce an attack technique, which is the Non-Uniform Illumination (NUI) of images to fool the CNN models. In this attack, the images are perturbed by adding a NUI mask of different intensities.

The (NUI) attack mask is created using several non-linear equations generating non-uniform variations of brightness and darkness exploiting the spatial structure of the image. We demonstrate how the proposed (NUI) attack degrades the performance of VGG and
ResNet models on various renowned datasets, including CIFAR10, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet. We evaluate the proposed attackâ€™s effectiveness on various classes of images.
